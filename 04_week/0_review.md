# Course review

Since we are meeting after two weeks, lets briefly discuss what we have completed in this course, what we are doing today, and what is the agenda for the future sessions.

- during the first week of the class, we talked about the curriculum, the tools we will be using, and other logistics related to class. We also talked about what we all did professionally and how we can all contribute to the course. With concensus, we removed/added things to the curriculum.
- we had the most dense class on the second week, we talked about Decision support systems, BI and other things from the context of what you would find in a text book, vs (also) what you would find in a large scale organization where Big data has taken over.
- we reviewed the materials for week two and then we formulated a plan for the rest of the modules. Since we can only learn by doing, we decided to create few datasets (that would match the real world scenario), and thought about what data real world might have.
- today: lets go through these discussions, new content with regards to the syllabus for today, and explore the datasets that has been created.
