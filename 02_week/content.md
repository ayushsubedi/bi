# Decision Support Systems
A decision support system (DSS) is an interactive information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. These software tools are developed for the specific purpose of assimilating pertinent data and generating a detail analysis of a given situation. The results can be utilized in making an informed decision regarding any set of circumstances. 

## Requirements for DSS
- Be interactive
- Incorporate the human element
- Use internal and external data
- Include models
- Support decision makers

## Major components
### Organizational Data
Structured and unstructured data (can be internal or external)

### Model
Mathematical and statistical models that along with the database, enable the DSS to analyze information. 


### Interface
How user access the DSS? example querying the database, accessing it via a dashboard, API etc.


## Types of features to support decision making

### What if
shows the effect of a change in one variable

### Goal seeking
reverse of what if, it asks what has to be done to achieve a particular goal

### Sensitivity
enables you to apply different variable, such as determining the maximum price you would pay for raw materials and still make profit

### Exception reporting
monitors performance of variable that are outside a defined range, such as pinpointing the region that generated hightst sale, or production center that went over budget.


## Users/Stakeholders
- user/consumer
  - what are the requirements? 
- managerial designer
  - what type of data should be collected?
  - how recent should the data be?
  - who are the end users?
  - how should the data be organized?
  - how should the data be updated?
  - how should the data be stored?
- technical designer
  - what type of file structure should be used?
  - what type of user access should be used?
  - what type of response time is required?
  - what type of security measures are needed?
  - decide to build the DSS from scratch/oursource/SaaS/purchase
- model builder
  - liaison between users and designers 
- UI/UX designer (etc.)

**DSS facilitates improvements but does not necessarily cause them.**
